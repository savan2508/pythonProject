This game is developed using the pythons pygame library. The
content is downloaded from the internet. The contents are AttackGraffiti

The gameplay of the Feed The Dragon is the dragon catches the coin

This script for the game is pretty generic, first the scrip defines the clock and
FPS for the game, which are 60 FPS. After that the script defines some default variables
for the game. Here is the list of the constant variables.
player_starting_life = 5
player_velocity = 15
coin_starting_velocity = 5
coin_acceleration = 0.5
buffer_distance = 100
score = 0

After that the script defines the colors which will be used frequently. The script
defines a few text for the HUD, game over and continue. Here are the list of the text
defined in the script.
score_text = Score: 00
title_text = Feed the Dragon
lives_text = Player Lives: 5
game_over_text = Game Over
continue_text = Press any key to Continue

The script imports the music which will be played while playing the game. The music
does not have any copyright. There are three music tracks are imported from the directory.
Those tracks are:
coin_sound = coin_sound.wav (played when the dragon eats the coin)
miss_sound = miss_sound.wav (played when the dragon misses the coin)
background music = ftd_background_music.wav (This track will be played while the game is played)


After that the game script start the main game loop using while. It based on the binary
variable running. The loop keep tracks of all the events and quit the game window when user hit
quit. The user can start playing the game and has the player icon has movement is restricted to the
y-axis only. The coin uses the random module to spawn randomly in the game screen.

The scrip uses the pygame method to detect whether coin rectangle and player icon rectangle
touches each other. Once they touch, the script increases the score or if dragon fails to catch
the coin, the script decrease a life. Once the lives are over, the game is over and gives the prompt
that lets user continue the game pressing any key.

Thank you. Hope you will enjoy the arcade game.
